            <h2>Puppy</h2>
            <p>A puppy is a juvenile dog. Some puppies can weigh 1–1.5 kg, while larger ones can weigh up to 7–11 kg. All puppies display primary altriciality and healthy puppies grow quickly after birth. A puppy's coat color may change as the puppy grows older, as is commonly seen in breeds such as the Yorkshire Terrier.</p>
